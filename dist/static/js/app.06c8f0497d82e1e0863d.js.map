src=\"../../assets/images/blog1.jpg\" class=\"rounded img-fluid\" />\n            <p class=\"mt-2\">\n              A new movie from award-winning filmmaker, Biodun Stephen, Picture Perfect, is set to hit the cinemas nationwide from July.\n              It features Bisola Aiyeola, Mary Remmy Njoku, Bolanle Ninalowo, Ronke Oshodi Oke, and others.\n              <br>\n              <br> Picture Perfect is a blend of comedy, reality and a jot of romance. It tells the story of a fashion designer\n              (Mary Remmy Njoku), who meets a notorious area boy, Jobe (Bolanle Ninalowo), when her car breaks down in his\n              neighbourhood. What seems to be a distressing situation turns out to be a blessing, only to go completely sideways\n              when he sets his home beside her shop. Written and produced by Stephen, who has also produced other movies\n              such as Ovy’s Voice, Tiwa’s Baggage and The Visit, it is directed by Tope Alake, with Mary Remmy Njoku-led\n              ROK Studios as co-executive producer.\n              <br>\n              <br> Shortly after the press premiere, Stephen said, “The movie was inspired by my tailor. At first glance, the\n              story seems like one of a damsel in distress, but it is more than that. It is not just your regular story.\n              Picture Perfect is about what makes a perfect father figure. Sometimes the picture perfect fathers are found\n              in the most imperfect human beings.”\n              <br>\n              <br> Stephen said the movie would change how citizens perceive thugs; it also tries to reveal the unfortunate situations\n              many find themselves by no fault of theirs. Many of them have good values that cannot easily be found in people\n              that are properly clothed. The movie explores different themes such as comedy, love and more.\n            </p>\n\n          </div>\n\n\n          <div class=\"col-lg-4\">\n            <h3 class=\"col-p\">Popular Post</h3>\n\n
